## Course Description

This course will introduce us to coding through the language of Python. On the one hand, the course will develop our fluency in Python and general coding skills. We will learn how to speak grammatically correct Python to the computer, we will learn about Python in the context of other languages, we will learn how to use libraries of Python code, and we will learn how to use Python to tell stories of our own. On the other hand, the course will expose us to ways that Python can be used in the humanities

**Project Idea**: Creating marketing solutions using medical datasets to increase exposure of neurological medical devices/treatments. 

**Class Objective**: I'm interested in not only learning the fundamentals of Python, but also learning how to create comprehensive visualizations using Python code.
